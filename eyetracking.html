            <h2>background information</h2>
            <p>A/B testing and eye tracking are important methods that help you gather information on what design considerations can increase the usability of your website. </p>
            <p>A/B testing, also known as split testing, refers to a randomized experimentation process where different versions of a webpage are shown to different visitors at the same time to determine which version has the best metrics like user retention, time to checkout, etc.. </p>
            <p>Eye tracking technology helps observe and measure eye movements to see where subjects focus there visual attention. Helping to determine what aspects of a webpage they engage with and what they ignore. </p>
            <p>This project focuses more on using eye tracking technology to inform design considerations for a bakery website. </p>

        <p style="font-style: italic;"><b>to get a better understanding of the interface, I started off by observing customers using the self checkout machine.</b></p>
            <h2>summary of observations</h2>
        <p>Each user went through the self checkout process relatively quickly and smoothly. Oftentimes, a user would click for the next step before the machine was able to finish saying the previous instruction, and there were some instances of users putting their cards in the slot before the machine prompted them to. A few of the users paused before setting things down on the scale or didn’t put things on the scale at all, delaying the process. Overall it was a pretty seamless sequence of tapping on the screen and scanning new items. </p>
        <p style="font-style: italic;"><b>After observing users, I conducted 3 user interviews asking about their experience with the interface.</b></p>
        <div class="interview">
                
                <div class="list">
                <h3>interview questions</h3>
                <ol >
                    <li>How often do you use this self check out over regular checkout?
                    </li>
                    <li>When you are using the self checkout are there any challenges you have?</li>
                    <li>How would you describe your past and current current experience with self checkout? Has it gotten easier to use?</li>
                    <li>How do you normally shop and pay for groceries?</li>
                    <li>Is there anything you look for when using self checkout that is missing or hard to find?</li>
                    <li>Is there any way self checkout isn’t supporting your needs currently?</li>
                    <li>If you had a question when using the self checkout do you know who to contact?</li>
                    <li>What is your first reaction when you approach the self check out machine?</li>
                    <li>How long does it typically take you to checkout/grocery shop?</li>

                        <h3>summary of interviews</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Users choose self checkout when they have less things, when they have more things they go to the cashier</li>
                    <li>Some users would like to use cash when paying for items, and think that the lights around the side of the machine is a misleading color. The light is blue, but some suggest it should be green to show “validation”</li>
                    <li>Both users and cashiers believe that there should be more clear signage as to which side the scale is on</li>
                    <li>Users find it easy to get help as the lights above the self checkout inform workers that customer has run into an issue</li>
                    <li>Overall users report that the interace is relatively easy to use and self explanatory</li>
                </ul>

        <p style="font-style: italic;"><b>Once I got a better dea of what types of users were using the self checkout machines and what their experiences were, I was ready to create personas.</b></p>
        <h2>personas</h2>
        <div class="personas">

        </div>
        <p style="font-style: italic;"><b>After creating these personas, I then developed a storyboard illustrating John's interaction with the interface.</b></p>
            <h2>storyboarding</h2>

        <div class="conclusion">
        <h2>concluding thoughts</h2>
        <p>Through the process of creating user personas and developing a storyboard I was able to document practical information about users, such as their different needs and motivations for using the checkout interface. With this information, the next possible step could be to develop a roadmap on how to deliver the end product with these user goals in mind, and iterate through ideas on how to solve pain points.</p>
