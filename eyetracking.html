        <h2>background information</h2>
        <p>A/B testing and eye tracking are important methods that help you gather information on what design considerations can increase the usability of your website. </p>
        <p>A/B testing, also known as split testing, refers to a randomized experimentation process where different versions of a webpage are shown to different visitors at the same time to determine which version has the best metrics like user retention, time to checkout, etc.. </p>
        <p>Eye tracking technology helps observe and measure eye movements to see where subjects focus there visual attention. Helping to determine what aspects of a webpage they engage with and what they ignore. </p>
        <p>This project focuses more on using eye tracking technology to test design hypotheses for a bakery website. In this project I worked with a group of four people to create two differently designed home pages for a bakery. The group of four was divded into two groups with each group making intentional design choices to test whether one approach gets better user metrics than another. </p>
        <h2>design considerations & hypotheses</h2>
        <p>One of the main design differences we chose for the two prototypes was the navigation bar positioning. In one of the designs, we placed the navbar is a horizontal position and the other vertical. With this, we hypothesized that the horizontal navigation bar would get more traction, as that follows customary website design layout. </p>
        <p>Additional design considerations included layout of products as well as whether or not to include additional information such as hours and location on the page. </p>
        <p>The two prototypes are depicted below:</p>
        <div class="prototype">
            <div>
                <img src = "bakery1.png">
            </div>
            <div>
                <img src = "bakery2.png">
            </div>

        </div>
        <h2>user eye tracking</h2>
        <p>After creating our prototypes, we then were able to do user testing with eye tracking technology. In our experiment we tasked two participants with navigating around the screen, following the path with their eyes of <b>what they would do if they were to choose three different items and proceed to order.</b> Once they finished the task, they informed us when they were done and the experiment was over. </p>
        <p>The eye tracking technology (as its name suggests) was able to track the participants eye movements to inform us on how they navigated through the page, and where most of their time was spent. </p>
        <p>The images below show heat maps and eye paths of the users for the two bakery pages.</p>
        <h4>heat maps showing where and relatively how long a user spent looking at a particular location:</h4>
        <div class="heatmap">
            <div>
                <img src = "heatmap.png">
            </div>
            <div>
                <img src = "heatmap2.png">
            </div>

        </div>
        <h4>replay images showing the eye path of the users during their task (not the full path, just a screenshot at a moment in time):</h4>
        <div class="heatmap">
            <div>
                <img src = "replay.png">
            </div>
            <div>
                <img src = "replay2.png">
            </div>

        </div>
        <h2>analysis</h2>
        <p>From the visualization we can see that the vertical navbar got more "eye time" than the horizontal navbar, as the horizontal navbar has no heat on the heatmap. In terms of the task of picking three items and then navigating to order/checkout being done efficiently, it seems to be most effective to only have items on the page rather than additional information like hours and location, as on the page that included additional information the viewer spent time looking over the information rather than focusing on the task at hand which was selecting items to checkout. </p>
        <p>In terms of layout of products, it seems that both methods of having all items displayed on the page and having tabs with the different categories so only one category shows at a time were able to get viewer traction, and were both effective ways to display items. </p>
        <div class="conclusion">
        <h2>concluding thoughts</h2>
        <p>I found this project really interesting as we were able to gather objective metrics on the two prototype designs. In the future I think it would be cool to use both measurements like eye tracking along with user interviews to understand both how a user navigates through a site as well as what their subjective thought process is. While both users were able to navigate through the products relatively efficiently, I do wonder whether they prefer to see all the products at once or if <I>think</i> that would be too cluttered. Overall, after seeing the measurements I was curious to learn more about preferences which could be hard to tell just by following eye paths. </p>
