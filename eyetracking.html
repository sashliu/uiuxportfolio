        <h2>background information</h2>
        <p>A/B testing and eye tracking are important methods that help you gather information on what design considerations can increase the usability of your website. </p>
        <p>A/B testing, also known as split testing, refers to a randomized experimentation process where different versions of a webpage are shown to different visitors at the same time to determine which version has the best metrics like user retention, time to checkout, etc.. </p>
        <p>Eye tracking technology helps observe and measure eye movements to see where subjects focus there visual attention. Helping to determine what aspects of a webpage they engage with and what they ignore. </p>
        <p>This project focuses more on using eye tracking technology to test design hypotheses for a bakery website. In this project I worked with a group of four people to create two differently designed home pages for a bakery. The group of four was divded into two groups with each group making intentional design choices to test whether one approach gets better user metrics than another. </p>
        <h2>design considerations & hypotheses</h2>
        <p>One of the main design differences we chose for the two prototypes was the navigation bar positioning. In one of the designs, we placed the navbar is a horizontal position and the other vertical. With this, we hypothesized that the horizontal navigation bar would get more traction, as that follows customary website design layout. </p>
        <p>Additional design considerations included layout of products as well as whether or not to include additional information such as hours and location on the page. </p>
        <p>The two prototypes are depicted below:</p>
