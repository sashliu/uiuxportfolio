    <h2>background information</h2>
    <p>Usability of a website and clarity of its content has a big effect on how a business’ main goal is perceived. While in my redesign project I was able to redesign a website to improve its usability, this project takes it a step further as I attempt to create a website solution to a startup’s concept.</p>
    <p>In this project I worked with a team to dive into four parts of iterative design flow: (1) sketching ideas of the interface, (2) creating an interactive, high-fidelity prototype, (3) conducting user testing on a final, revised prototype, and (4) contacting the startup. </p>
    <p>Before putting pen to paper, my group first chose a startup from Ycombinator to create a website for. My group chose numi, a plant based seafood company aimed at promoting a sustainable food system. After choosing our startup, we started to brainstorm what type of interface we wanted to design as well as what users would be impacted by our interface and why. Following this brainstorm we began sketching</p>
    <h2>sketching</h2>
    <p>We were able to identify that the potential users for our interface could be food wholesalers looking to sell numi products, or simply plant based eaters interested in learning more about this new meat alternative. With this, going into our sketches we wanted to show visual representations of the products as well as clear information on production processes and the environmental impact.</p>
    <p>Below are some initial sketches that we developed:</p>
    <div class="sketches">

    </div>
    <h2>wireframing</h2>
    <p>The sketches helped us visualize our ideas and weigh out the benefits of different designs. After we looked through all of our different sketch ideas, we were able to combine different aspects from different sketches to create one wireframe we could iterate on.</p>
    <p>We were able to create lofi prototypes on Balsamiq for various interfaces to illustrate ideas of potential responsiveness of the site, and also help us decide which interface to focus on.</p>
    <p>With a goal of educating users of numi's products we aimed to include a lot of visual representations on the site as well as pages that inform users on processes and impact.</p>

    <h2>mockup critiques</h2>
    <p>After making our lofi prototypes, we then were able to iterate on that idea and move onto the hifi prototype. We created the hifi prototype in figma and included interactive components like page navigation. </p>
    <p>When the initial hifi prototype was finished we were able to take our prototype in for studio critique. Obtaining peer critique was critical in this process as it made us aware of aspects on the site that were not clear or intuitive. As my team has already spent a lot of time with our design we were accustomed to it and understood the different reasoning behind our design choices, but getting fresh eyes on the prototypes allowed us to see issues we did not see before. </p>
    <p>I am not able to show the initial hifi prototypes here as we made improvements before documenting that part of the process. </p>
    <div class="list">
        <h3>here are some of the critique notes that we received:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The “our process” page is confusing as on a desktop screen the visualization is too big and the user has to scroll up and down to view the whole picture. Additionally it doesn’t make sense why the food production is a cycle, need to clarify content. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Should be more emphasis on why this company is better than other sustainable food companies. Could be helpful to provide more information on environmental impact. 
            </li>
            <li>
                The user should be able to tell what the company is/does on the home page, and that isn’t so clear.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add some space on footers so different buttons are more discernible.
            </li>
            <li>
                Make sure design considerations are consistent throughout the page. 
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <h2>final mockup</h2>
    <p>Taking the peer critique that received into account, we then iterated on the initial mockup and made edits to improve the clarity and impact of the design.</p>
    <div class="list">
        <h3>here are some of the improvements that we made:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Made the “our process” section a slide show, increasing the clarity by not displaying it as a cycle (because it is not a cycle) and also allowing for the user to clearly see each aspect on the page without having to scroll up and down. The slideshow also allows for the user to intuitively see the ordered steps of the process.</li>
            <li>Created a “mission” page which emphasizes the beneficial impact the company has on the environment.</li>
            <li>Clearly stated what the company does on the homepage so the user instantly knows when they navigate to the website. </li>
            <li>Add a section that targets wholesaler customers who want to purchase numi foods for their stores (this was a neglected user in our preliminary design). </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <p>Click through our protoype to view our design and explore Numi Foods.</p>

    </div>
    <h2>user testing</h2>
    <p>After creating our edited mockup, we wanted to put our design to the test. To do this, we submitted our prototype for user testing. We provided tasks for 3 users to complete and encouraged them to express their thought processes as they navigate through the mockup. </p>
    <div class="center">
    <div class="task">
        <h3>here are the tasks that we provided:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Explore the homepage</li>
            <li>Navigate to "about us”</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Try to learn more about the nutrition of available products</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Navigate to the “our process” section</li>
            <ul><li>What is the last step in the process?</li></ul>
            <li>Try to learn more about why started numi</li>
            <li>Explore the career section</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

<p>here are the videos from our user testing:</p>

<h2>user testing summary</h2>
<p>The goal of user testing was to understand more about our design and discover potential errors that we were unaware of. </p>
<p>After watching the user testing videos, we were able to compile a summary from the different interactions. </p>   
<p>Within our tasks we directed the users to explore our website in its entirety and learn more about how the website tried to entice customers to buy its products. Our subtasks consisted of directing users to click through each element of the navigation bar as well as interact with the elements on each page. </p>
<p>We expected users to follow the order we laid out (home -> products -> our process -> our mission -> careers). When watching the videos, we noticed that there were some critiques that were consistent among the three users. The way we utilized whitespace was meant to separate sections, however, the spacing was a bit inconsistent. Users also notices small grammatical errors throughout our website which “decreased the credibility” of our company. Some of the users liked our simplistic choice of color scheme, with one exception as a user commented that we could “use a bit more color” in order to spice up the look of the page. Overall the users liked the simplistic design of our website, and the main critique was that the cohesiveness broke down due to minor inconsistencies between pages.</p>
<p>Along with design critique, we were also able to uncover errors that we had missed through user testing. From the videos we were able to see that the users found no difficulty navigating the site, however, one error encountered was that the “learn” button from out products page did not work. Aside from that, users commented on general formatting and style. </p>
<div class="conclusion">
    <h2>concluding thoughts and potential improvements</h2>
    <p>This project provided a sneak peak into the iterative design process. While we only went through a couple of iterations, many more rounds of critique and improvements can be done. From our user testing results, to improve the website we would need to address the formatting and grammar issues that users pointed out. Another area that could be improved is cohesiveness of the site layout. Creating a cohesive site was a challenge we encountered along the process working in a group. Additionally, the final product was just a figma mockup. In a real world scenario after many iterations of design improvements we would then create a live site with full navigation functionality. In this project only some aspects of the page were navigable. This project informed me on the importance of going through iterations of testing and critique to make the site accessible and attractive to a wide range of users</p>
